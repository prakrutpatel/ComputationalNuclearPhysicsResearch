           (J,PR/C,21,830,1980) It is O1199 and details of
           experiments.
SAMPLE     Both solid and gas targets were used. Gaseous targets
           allow greater precision in the determination of the
           values of the target density and therefore of the
           relative cross sections for different nuclei. For this
           reason gaseous targets were used whenever possible-14
           nuclei- while for other nuclei self-supporting metal
           foils of uniform thickness were utilized. When solid
           targets in this form were not available or were too
           difficult to obtain, chemical compounds deposited on a
           plastic film were used. In cases 14-nuclei usually
           obtained cross section values relative to some other
           nucleus, generally O-16, contained in the chemical
           compound. A plastic film of moplefan (C(3)H(4))N,
           which does not contain oxygen, was used backing. The
           isotopic enrichment was generally more than 90%. For
           some nuclei-O-17, Si-30, Ca-42,43, Ti-47,50, Fe-58 and
           Zn-67 the enrichment was smaller but the percentage of
           the various isotopes contained in the target was known.
           In these cases several targets were used, as many as
           the isotopes studied but with a different isotope
           content. In two cases, those B and Cl-targets
           containing the natural isotope mixture were used.

ERR-ANALYS The uncertainty in the cross section for each point in
           the angular distribution is due to statistical and
           systematic errors. Counting statistics give sizeable
           contributions only at backward angles. For elastic
           scattering the statistical error is generally smaller
           than 4% even in the minima of the angular distributions
           at backward angles. Systematic errors results from
           several causes. The absolute uncertainties due to beam
           current integration and dead time corrections are very
           small being of the order of 0.2% and less than 1%,
           respectively. The error due to the uncertainty in the
           determination of solid angles reaches a maximum value
           of the order of 1.5% for solid and 3% for gaseous
           targets. The uncertainty in the measurement of target
           thickness and uniformity is of order of 3-8% and for
           most solid targets constitutes the largest source of
           error. The effective thickness of gas target is
           proportional to N*D*SINQ, the uncertainty in N-the
           number of nuclei cm**3-is estimated to be approximately
            1%, while the contributions coming from D-the width
           of the front slit-and Q-the scattering angle are
           already included in the 3% error mentioned above for
           the solid angle of gaseous targets. The overall
           systematic errors are therefore smaller for these
           targets than for solid ones. At small angles other
           systematic errors may be present. In fact the
           extraction of the scattering yields is generally
           straightforward except for elastic peaks at forward
           angles, where events produced by contaminants or other
           nuclei present in the target have to be separated.
