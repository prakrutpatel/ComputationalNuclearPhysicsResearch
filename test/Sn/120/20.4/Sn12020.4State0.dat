TITLE      Elastic and Inelastic Scattering of Protons from
           120Sn for Ep = 20.6, 25.2, 30.6 and 36.2 MeV:

SAMPLE     (50-SN-120,ENR=0.99) The 120Sn target was nominally
           4.5 mg/cm2 and >99% enriched.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A cooled Ge(Li) planer detector.
PART-DET   (P)
METHOD     (PHD) Protons scattered from the l20Sn target were
           detected using a Ge(Li) detector mounted so that the
           protons entered the side of the detector and were
           stopped in the depleted region. The total energy
           resolution (FWHM) was ~0.1% for each incident energy
           used. Pulses from the detector were amplified,
           converted to digital form, transferred to memory of a
           PDP-8 computer, and the resulting spectra were stored
           on magnetic tape. Peak areas were extracted using a
           peak-stripping routine written for a PDP-7 computer.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) For elastic scattering the errors due to
           counting statistics were small, and the major
           contribution to delta sigma was the estimate of
           uncertainties associated with our knowledge of the
           variation of the target thickness in the region
           struck by the beam.
           (ERR-1,2.,4.) In the region struck by the beam, the
           variation in target thickness amounted to 3 +- 1%.
