           Polarized-proton scattering by even-mass Ge and Se
           isotopes.  Some details of experimental setup.
HISTORY    (20040114C)
           (20090828A).Correction in author' list has been done,
           according V.Zerkin remarks.
SAMPLE     The targets were self-supporting metallic foils of
           about 1-mg/cm**2.
           They were enriched to over 96% in the relevant isotope,
           except for the rare isotope Zn-70.
ADD-RES    (COMP) DWBA calculations.
           (POT) Parameters of optical model were obtained using
           optical model code OPTIMO.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Surface-barrier detectors.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2NEDENT) The polarized-beam facility of the
            Eindhoven AVF cyclotron.
METHOD     (BCINT)

ERR-ANALYS (ANG-ERR-D).Data-point reader uncertainty.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.
CORRECTION The corrections for isotopic impurities were
           appreciable.  Inevitable the targets also contained
           some contamination of carbon and oxygen.  Corrections
           were made using data obtained by scattering from mylar
           and polyethylene foils.
