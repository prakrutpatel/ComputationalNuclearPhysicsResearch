HISTORY    (20031229C)
           (20040328U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Self-supporting metallic foils, 600-1000 mug/cm**2
           thickness, isotopic purity 96-98%, except for the rare
           isotopes Cd-106, Cd-108 which were 91% and 64% pure,
           respectivily.
REL-REF    (R,O1103001,W.MOONEN+,J,JP/G,19,635,1993) Details of
           experiment.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Coupled-channels formalism.
           (STRUC) Deformation strenghts describing the excitation
           of different states.
DETECTOR   (SILI) 3-mm thick lithium-drifted silicon detectors,
           that were cooled by a Peltier device.
INC-SOURCE (POLIS) The beam polarization was reversed every few
           minutes.  The degree of polarization was continuously
           monitored.
INC-SPECT  *En-rsl* the overall energy resolution.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2NEDENT) The polarized-proton facility of the
            Eindhoven cyclotron.
METHOD     (SITA)
ERR-ANALYS A minimal error of 2% was assumed in the values of
           cross section and analysing power due to the
           normalization procedure.
           (ANG-ERR-D).Data-point reader uncertainty.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.
