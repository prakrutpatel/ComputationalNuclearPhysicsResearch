SAMPLE     Highly Enriched Thin Targets of Ho-165,Yb-172,174,176,
           W-182,184,186,Os-188,190,192 and Pt-194,198 were
           Produced by Evaporating the Metal from the Oxide Form,
           And Depositing It on a Thin Carbon Film.The Thickness
           Of the Metal Deposited Varied from About 50 to 100
           Mug/Cm**2,Depending Upon the Target.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Optical Model,DWBA and Coupled-Channel Analyses.
           (POT) Optical Model Parameters.
           Quadrupole Deformation Parameters.
DETECTOR   (SOLST). Cooled Si(LI) Detectors were Used.

COMMENT    /by Compiler/.The Energies of the First 2+ State were
           Getting by Compiler from ENSDF-96.
METHOD     (SITA)
           The Resulting Angular Distributions were Converted to
           Absolute Cross Sections by Normalizing with Respect to
           Angular Distributions Taken at 5 MeV Incident Proton
           Energy, with the Identical Experimental Configurations
           S in the 16 MeV Runs. The 5 MeV Data were Assumed to be
           Purely Rutherford.
