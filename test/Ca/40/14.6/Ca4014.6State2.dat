SAMPLE     The Calcium Target was a Natural Calcium Foil (99.6%
           CA-40), Which was Rolled in Air to a Thickness of
            5.8 Mg/Cm**2.As Calcium Oxidizes Very Rapidly When
           Exposed to Air,the Target Prepared in this Way was
           Heavily Contaminated with Oxygen, and in Fact was
           Somewhat Wrinkled As a Results of Chemical Changes
           Occurring After the Target was Mounted.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
