SAMPLE     The Calcium Target were Prepared by Evaporating
           Natural Mettallic Calcium onto an Aluminium Backing
           Under Vacuum.When the Calcium had Accumulated to
           Convenient Thicknesses (MORE THAN 1 MG/CM**2) It Could
           Easily be Peeled Off the Backing As a Smooth Foil and
           Storage of the Target in Vacuum Immediately After
           Mounting Considerably Reduced the Oxygen Contamination.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           (DATA-ERR).Data-Point Reader Uncertainty.
