INC-SOURCE (LAMB) 55% Polarized Beam on Target.
SAMPLE     The Targets Used were About 3 Mg/Cm**2 Which
           Corresponds  to an Energy Loss of 80-100 KeV.The Ca-40,
           Ca-44  Targets  were  99.99%  and  98.5%   Isotopically
           Enriched, Respectively. The Ca-48 Target had a 3.6%
           Ca-40 Impurity.
COMMENT    /by Authors/.To Determine the Normalizations of Our
           Cross-Section Data We Used Targets of 1 Mg/Cm**2 or
           Loss and Measured the Yield at 4.00 MeV Where the
           Scattering is Rutherford at Forward Angles.These
           Normalizations are Estimated to be Accurate to Within
            10 %.It was Found That the Nuclear Size Determinations
           Were Relatively Insensitive to Normalization.

DETECTOR   (SILI).2 mm Si(LI) Detectors were Used.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USARUT)
METHOD     (SITA)
           2 mm Si(LI) Detectors in a Left-Right Configuration
           Were Used in Order to Measure Assymmetry.
ERR-ANALYS The Statistical Uncertainties in the Cross Section
           Data  are  1%. Relative Errors of 2% were Assigned For
           The  Optical-Model Analyses to Account For Angular
           Misalignments. Errors Assigned to the Analyzing-Power
           Data are Statistical and Include the  Uncertainties in
           The Measured Beam  Polarization. Typical Errors For
           These Data are 2%.
