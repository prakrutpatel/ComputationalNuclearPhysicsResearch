DETECTOR   (SOLST).The Scattered Protons were Detected with an
           Array of Five 2.95-Mm-Thick Lithium-Drifted Silicon
           Detectors.The Detecter Array was Operated at Liquid-
           Nitrogen Temperatures.
           (NAICR).Two Gamma Detectors were Employed-An Rca 7046
           Photomultiplier Coupled to a 10-Cm-Diam by 10-Cm-Long
           Nai(TL) Crystal was Used For the C-12 and Ni-58
           Targets,and an Rca 4522 Coupled to a 12.7-Cm-Diam by
            10-Cm-Long Nai(TL) Crystal was Used For the Fe-54
           Target.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAWAU).The Proton Beam Used in these
           Experiments was Produced by the University of
           Washington Three-Stage Tandem Van De Graaff
           Accelerator.
METHOD     (SITA)
ADD-RES    (COMP).Collective-Model Distorted-Wave Born-
           Approximation.
